      <p>
        DeFi, or decentralized finance, has brought about a revolutionary shift in the financial industry. However, this
        transformation hasn&apos;t occurred without its fair share of challenges. The soaring popularity of DeFi
        platforms has led to blockchain congestion, resulting in exorbitant gas fees that hinder accessibility and
        scalability for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This issue pertains to infrastructure and blockchain architecture, and although numerous ingenious solutions
        have been devised to address it, many of these solutions achieve scalability at the expense of security or
        decentralization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dozer has chosen to build upon the Hathor Network, which arguably resolves the blockchain trilemma and offers a
        user-friendly approach.
      </p>
      <div className="flex -mt-10">
        <Button
          as="a"
          target="_blank"
          href="https://youtu.be/6s3Hkog7bdc"
          className="!p-0 mt-3"
          variant="empty"
          endIcon={<VideoCameraIcon width={16} height={16} />}
        >
          Hathor BlockDag
        </Button>
      </div>

      <p>
        Additionally, we employ Nano Contracts for dApp logic. These contract implementations mitigate risks and ensure
        a more secure execution while being less complex than Solidity. This ensures a reliable and swift development
        process, enabling upgrades and delivering greater value to users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last but certainly not least, we are not reinventing the wheel; rather, we are absorbing the insights from
        previous DeFi implementations, learning from their shortcomings, and crafting an enhanced journey for both our
        users and investors.
