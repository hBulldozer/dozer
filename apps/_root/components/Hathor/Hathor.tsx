      <p>
        DeFi, or decentralized finance, has revolutionized the financial industry, but not without challenges.The
        growing popularity of DeFi platforms has caused congestion on blockchains, leading to exorbitant gas fees that
        hinders accessibility and scalability for users. â€™
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a infraestrucure and blockchain architecture issue, a lot of clever solutions were made to solve this
        issue but most of them achieve escalability at the cost of security or decentralization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dozer choose to build upon Hathor Network that arguably solve the blockchain tryllema and has a easy to use
        approuch.

      <p>
        We also are using Nano Contracts for the dApp logics, this is a contract implementation that mitigates risks and
        ensure a more secure implementation while being less complicated than solidity. This ensures a sure and fast
        paced development facilitating upgrades and delivering more value to users
      </p>
      <p>
        The last but not least, we are not reinventing the wheel, we are absorving all the previus DeFi implementations
        learning from their mistakes to craft the better journey for both our users and investors.
